We have updated your maps. Since we now have these relocations, we technically have two Eugene projects active so you have two different maps.

We moved them to all of the poles that Bret suggested. Some of these locations will end up getting cross captures which can be good and can be a hindrance sometimes. Cross captures are great for getting vehicles going in both directions. However, sometimes plates can be mixed if two cars pass each other at just the right time.\n\n\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\tPlease review when you can and let me know your thoughts.\n\n\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\tBret,\n\n\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\tIf the Detective and his team are good with these locations, are we approved to get moving on scheduling the relocations\n\n\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\tRegards\n\n\t\n \n\nMatt Triana\nProject Manager\n\n\n 949-547-3560 <tel:949-547-3560>    flocksafety.com \n\n\t\n https://www.foxbusiness.com/technology/safety-tech-company-launches-tool-help-law-enforcement-fight-human-trafficking?utm_campaign=EmailSignature&utm_source=PMO&utm_medium=Wisestamp \n\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\tOn Thu, Jun 12, 2025 at 12:30?PM DEWITT Derek A <DDeWitt@eugene-or.gov DDeWitt@eugene-or.gov > wrote:\n\n\t\t\t\t\tI will let you guys go through and determine the best locations based on where they were previously.

We moved them to all of the poles that Bret suggested. Some of these locations will end up getting cross captures which can be good and can be a hindrance sometimes. Cross captures are great for getting vehicles going in both directions. However, sometimes plates can be mixed if two cars pass each other at just the right time.\n\n\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\tPlease review when you can and let me know your thoughts.\n\n\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\tBret,\n\n\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\tIf the Detective and his team are good with these locations, are we approved to get moving on scheduling the relocations\n\n\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\tRegards\n\n\t\n \n\nMatt Triana\nProject Manager\n\n\n 949-547-3560 <tel:949-547-3560>    flocksafety.com \n\n\t\n https://www.foxbusiness.com/technology/safety-tech-company-launches-tool-help-law-enforcement-fight-human-trafficking?utm_campaign=EmailSignature&utm_source=PMO&utm_medium=Wisestamp \n\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\tOn Thu, Jun 12, 2025 at 12:30?PM DEWITT Derek A <DDeWitt@eugene-or.gov DDeWitt@eugene-or.gov > wrote:\n\n\t\t\t\t\tI will let you guys go through and determine the best locations based on where they were previously.
