If he can provide either a map or a list of what is city traffic poles or what isn�t in the city, we can work together on moving the cameras.  My suspicion is that most of the cameras on Flock poles are near intersections that are city owned and we can adjust them accordingly.  When looking at the map, its hard for me to decipher what is on a Flock pole verse an existing pole without clicking on each one.  If we could start by sending a list with each location that will need to be evaluated, I can start working on locating suitable replacement locations and then we can verify with Bret that those locations are indeed city owned.\n\n\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\tLet me know what you think,\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tDerek\n\n\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\tDetective D.

      "body": "Good morning,\n\n\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\tI would like to see how we can work through this with the least amount of work put onto Bret as he has a full time job that�s not with the PD and has been gracious enough to help us with this project.  If he can provide either a map or a list of what is city traffic poles or what isn�t in the city, we can work together on moving the cameras.  My suspicion is that most of the cameras on Flock poles are near intersections that are city owned and we can adjust them accordingly.  When looking at the map, its hard for me to decipher what is on a Flock pole verse an existing pole without clicking on each one.  If we could start by sending a list with each location that will need to be evaluated, I can start working on locating suitable replacement locations and then we can verify with Bret that those locations are indeed city owned.\n\n\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\tLet me know what you think,\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tDerek\n\n\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\tDetective D.

The installed number is inclusive of the ones that have been pushed down.\n\n\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\tFlock poles installed - 17\n\n\t\t\tFlock poles not yet installed - 5\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\tWe all agree that we need to proceed with relocating these to existing poles. Best way would probably be to get on a call with Brett to go over city managed traffic light locations. If he cannot get on a call, I can send him location info for each of the Flock poles and then he can let us know the nearest traffic light that works.
