One for police-related cameras and another for installing streetlights.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\tAs it stands, our existing attachment license does not cover these types of attachments. Therefore, we will need to execute a new addendum to our current licensing agreement to approve these attachments. To move forward, please have the person responsible for reviewing such agreements contact me. I will then provide the initial documents that Lumen requires to draft the additional agreement. \n\n\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\tOnce the new agreement is signed, the city will need to submit applications for camera attachments to Lumen for approval. On a related note, I am already working on the streetlight applications with William Carter, who has been included in this email for coordination within the city.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\tPlease let me know if you have any additional questions or concerns.    \n\n\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\n\n \n\nLaurie Brown \n\nLead Technical Program Manager\n\nLumen Joint Use Management\n\ntel: (253) 458-6573|  \n\nLaurie.Brownmorgan@lumen.com https://urldefense.com/v3/__http:/Laurie.Brownmorgan@lumen.com*20__;JQ!!CdLFVIQ!V5Y2TwZ_UaZVpeD-gwRBF0CeKemkNiAuunvUnl28937kEnoA0lio51Va6Gq6RStlPGKTYppjrQNQD0fi1Hdi4YR5sVy5muXf$  \n\nPronouns � She/Her"
