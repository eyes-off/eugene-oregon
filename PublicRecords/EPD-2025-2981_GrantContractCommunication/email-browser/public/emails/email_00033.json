If he can provide either a map or a list of what is city traffic poles or what isn�t in the city, we can work together on moving the cameras.  My suspicion is that most of the cameras on Flock poles are near intersections that are city owned and we can adjust them accordingly.  When looking at the map, its hard for me to decipher what is on a Flock pole verse an existing pole without clicking on each one.  If we could start by sending a list with each location that will need to be evaluated, I can start working on locating suitable replacement locations and then we can verify with Bret that those locations are indeed city owned.\n\n\t \n\n\tLet me know what you think,\n\n\t\n\tDerek\n\n\t \n\n\tDetective D.
