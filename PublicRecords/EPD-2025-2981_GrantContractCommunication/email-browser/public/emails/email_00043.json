You may view the current F053 location on the Eugene PD Deployment Plan https://planner.flocksafety.com/planning-portal/deployment-tracker/public/0f92e14e805f30bf6acf29115ee1c58276056f7f841b1e62576ad7ebe9d195c941630a89d13cb02bc37914c3dde5d508db881988d2605f5016b34944b71976ac .\n \nPlan is to shift to the traffic signal at these coordinates https://www.google.com/maps/place/44%C2%B001'27.4%22N+123%C2%B004'30.7%22W/@44.0243283,-123.0752058,200m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m4!3m3!8m2!3d44.0242647!4d-123.0752058?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI1MDYwMy4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D . We installed this camera less than 30 days ago so I believe we can relocate this one at no cost to the PD and Detective Dewitt, who is on this email.\n \nPlease start the relocation process and let me know when the opp is ready.
