If the PD does want to be invoiced, it will be emailed to ap@ci.eugene.or.us ap@ci.eugene.or.us  upon reinstallation.\n2.\tIs the Flock pole still on site? If yes, please leave it as is; this will be a marker for 811 digging approval needs.\n3.\tIs all other equipment (i.e. the camera) still on site? If so, please leave all equipment as is. If not, please confirm the address where we can pick up the equipment, and if there is anything we should reference/someone we should ask for upon doing so; we understand that personnel availability changes frequently in a public safety setting, so we are happy to connect with administrative staff to obtain equipment if they have a more flexible schedule.\n\nRegarding the heartbeat of the camera after it was removed, it probably still had power stored from the solar panel. \n\n \n\nStay safe,\n\nGeorge\n\n \n\n \n\n--------------- Original Message ---------------\nFrom: Flock Safety Support [support@flocksafety.com]\nSent: 6/2/2025, 9:59 AM\nTo: gaby.mahoney@flocksafety.com gaby.mahoney@flocksafety.com \nCc: ddewitt@eugene-or.gov ddewitt@eugene-or.gov \nSubject: Re: Flock LPR stolen / damaged\n\nHi there,\n\nThank you for reaching out!
