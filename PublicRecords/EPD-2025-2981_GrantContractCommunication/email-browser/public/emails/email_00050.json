We installed this camera less than 30 days ago so I believe we can relocate this one at no cost to the PD and Detective Dewitt, who is on this email.\n\nPlease start the relocation process and let me know when the opp is ready. Please also let me know what I can do to help.\n\nThank you!\n\t\n \nMatt Triana\nProject Manager\n\n\n\n \t \n <https://tracy.srv.wisestamp.com/px/wsid/N8dQjWVQ3Zda.png>",
