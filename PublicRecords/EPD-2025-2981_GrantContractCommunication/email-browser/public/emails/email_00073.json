Tobin looped in someone else from Lumen to assist with whatever joint use agreement they need. Hopefully she will get back to us with some info soon.\n\n\tBy my count, we have a total of thirteen cameras left to install. Aside from the one Lumen pole location, some of these are city locations that we recently moved and are pending approval to move forward with from the city. Then there are the two county locations and the county told us recently that they were \"sending these to permit processing.\" We will be following up with them next week.

EPD�s request is listed at the bottom of the thread and City of Eugene�s Traffic Manager is in the loop. \n\n\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\tThe locations I believe are located where cameras/IT already exist, ITS has already stated this not allowed (shown below), and State Traffic suggested reaching out to you. \n\n\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\tIf a TEAMS call easier that works also.

I understand the recent effort involves the requesting law enforcement agency entering into an IGA with ODOT, and ODOT issuing a permit under the IGA criteria.  I haven�t been working on this personally so I don�t know more details.  Mike suggested you contact Galen McGill and R3 Manager Darrin Neavoll about the current work and how the City of Eugene�s request might fit in.  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t-Angela"
