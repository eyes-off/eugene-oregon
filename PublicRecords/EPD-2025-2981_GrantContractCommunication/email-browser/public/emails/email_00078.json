The half pole and camera were located nearby. The camera appears intact and free of damage. The solar panel was stolen. I have a few questions related to this.\n\nThe location is \"P#043 W 29th Ave @ Willamette St WB. Serial 241217P02100813.\n\n\n1. Is flock a victim in this or are we the victim? Essentially, who must pay for the solar panel and the new pole installation. Either way, I need to know the price of the LPR camera, the pole, and the solar panel. That will impact the charge if and when a suspect is identified.\n2. The camera showed that it was live for about 24 hours after it was removed from the pole. I searched and no photos were taken after 3:10 am on 5/28/25. Once the camera is disconnected, does it not record any additional photos? Why would it show to have had a \"heartbeat\" for another 18-24 hours afterwards.\n3. What's the process on this moving forward.\n\nDerek\n\nDetective D.
