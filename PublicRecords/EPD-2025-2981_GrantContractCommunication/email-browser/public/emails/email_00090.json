The camera share process is manual on the Flock side and once approved we will do our best to complete these in a timely manner. \n\n\nIf your agency has any questions or concerns, they may reach out to their Flock customer success manager who will direct them to the appropriate contact. \n\n\n \n\n� \n\nPlease review template below, no action is required:\n\n\n\n\nThe Home Depot would like to provide your agency with state-wide access to The Home Depot owned Flock safety systems. This technology will assist in preventing or investigating criminal activity in the local community we both serve. The Home Depot technology and your department�s access to such should only be used for bona fide investigations, which are documented within your department and via audit trail within the Flock Safety platform. These investigative tools and technology will not be permitted for personal use, for use on unauthorized devices or by unauthorized users within your department.
