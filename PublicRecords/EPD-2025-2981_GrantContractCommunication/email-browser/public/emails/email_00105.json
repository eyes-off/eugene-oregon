As Angela says, we are working on allowing them. We had 3 communities go out and put them on our R/W without permission and we had to have them removed. We are going to work with one of the communities to develop an IGA that would allow these on R/W. Within the IGA we will require anything that is installs a ground mount we will all do a Land Use Permit that will cost them $250 for the first year and $100 every year after. At this time we are saying nothing attached to our features or on interstate. \n\n\t \n\n\tWe would like to get one through the process and then finalize our process and then open it up statewide.

We are going to work with one of the communities to develop an IGA that would allow these on R/W. Within the IGA we will require anything that is installs a ground mount we will all do a Land Use Permit that will cost them $250 for the first year and $100 every year after. At this time we are saying nothing attached to our features or on interstate. \n\n\t \n\n\tWe would like to get one through the process and then finalize our process and then open it up statewide.
