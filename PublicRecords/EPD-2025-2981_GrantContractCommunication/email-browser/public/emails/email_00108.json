Be conscious of the information you share if you respond. \tJames, \n \nThank you for the call back.  As I said on the phone we are working on procuring Automated License plate (ALPR) from Flock Safety.  Of the 58 locations we would be getting cameras in the City of Eugene, it was discovered some may be property of ODOT or maintained by ODOT. \n \n Here was the list \n \n \nPrivate Property Permission needed for:\n*   F#024 SR 99 @ Roosevelt Blvd NB - SR 99 is ODOT ROW \n*   F#025 SR 99 @ Barger Dr NB - SR 99 is ODOT ROW\n*   F#038 Franklin Bl @ Walnut St WB - Franklin (SR99) ODOT \nAlternate Locations needed: ODOT ROW is too wide so private property not an option\n*   F039 - SR 99 @ Jessen Dr SB\n*   F#042 Randy Pape Beltline @ W 11th Ave NB\nOther locations to confirm: \n*   F#019 Club Rd @ I105 SB\n*   F#031 Club Rd @ I105 NB\n*   F#044 River Rd @ Willow Springs Dr SB\n*   F#045 Green Acres Rd @ N Delta Hwy EB\n*   F#056 N Delta Hwy @ Randy Pape Beltline NB\n \nAfter speaking with my traffic engineering I believe I have identified which are COE owned and which are ODOT owned.  If I am incorrect please let me know . \n \n*   Locations not highlighted are COE owned properties \n*   Highlighted in Blue are ODOT owned properties managed by COE \n*   Highlighted in Red are COE owned properties managed by ODOT\n*   Highlighted in Yellow are ODOT owned and maintained \n \nWhat I am asking is for permissions to have ALPR cameras (installed by Flock) placed either on existing infrastructure or right-away at the locations controlled or owned by ODOT.  If yes, what would ODOT require from EPD and/or Flock.  \n \nThank you and have a great weekend! \n \n \n \n \n \nJake Burke\nCaptain � Investigations Division\nEugene Police Department\n300 Country Club Road\nEugene, Oregon 97401\n(541) 682-5895 work",

As I said on the phone we are working on procuring Automated License plate (ALPR) from Flock Safety.  Of the 58 locations we would be getting cameras in the City of Eugene, it was discovered some may be property of ODOT or maintained by ODOT. \n \n Here was the list \n \n \nPrivate Property Permission needed for:\n*   F#024 SR 99 @ Roosevelt Blvd NB - SR 99 is ODOT ROW \n*   F#025 SR 99 @ Barger Dr NB - SR 99 is ODOT ROW\n*   F#038 Franklin Bl @ Walnut St WB - Franklin (SR99) ODOT \nAlternate Locations needed: ODOT ROW is too wide so private property not an option\n*   F039 - SR 99 @ Jessen Dr SB\n*   F#042 Randy Pape Beltline @ W 11th Ave NB\nOther locations to confirm: \n*   F#019 Club Rd @ I105 SB\n*   F#031 Club Rd @ I105 NB\n*   F#044 River Rd @ Willow Springs Dr SB\n*   F#045 Green Acres Rd @ N Delta Hwy EB\n*   F#056 N Delta Hwy @ Randy Pape Beltline NB\n \nAfter speaking with my traffic engineering I believe I have identified which are COE owned and which are ODOT owned.  If I am incorrect please let me know . \n \n*   Locations not highlighted are COE owned properties \n*   Highlighted in Blue are ODOT owned properties managed by COE \n*   Highlighted in Red are COE owned properties managed by ODOT\n*   Highlighted in Yellow are ODOT owned and maintained \n \nWhat I am asking is for permissions to have ALPR cameras (installed by Flock) placed either on existing infrastructure or right-away at the locations controlled or owned by ODOT.  If yes, what would ODOT require from EPD and/or Flock.  \n \nThank you and have a great weekend! \n \n \n \n \n \nJake Burke\nCaptain � Investigations Division\nEugene Police Department\n300 Country Club Road\nEugene, Oregon 97401\n(541) 682-5895 work"
