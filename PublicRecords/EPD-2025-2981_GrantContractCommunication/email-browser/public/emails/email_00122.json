I will circle back, I think at this time it will be product feedback rather than a solution we currently have \n\t\t\t6.\tHeat Map - Can you search a license plate > right corner instead of going to the map view like we did can you toggle to \"look up\" and let me know if this works?\n\n\t\t\t\t*\tAlso, on the search card, you can click Nationwide Look Up or State Look Up and you should be able to see the heat map for that as well\n\t\t\t\t*\tInstructions HERE https://help.flocksafety.com/s/article/How-to-Use-the-Lookup-Tool-in-Search  (photo example down below)\n\t\t\t\t*\t\n\n\t\t\t7.\tDevice Group - This does look like you have to toggle on the device group each time.
