You asked really great questions and I'm excited to follow up on our next call on Thursday to make sure they have all been answered. In the meantime, if you don't mind sharing that doc where you had your questions written that would be great (I want to make sure I'm not missing anything). Please let me know if you have any additional ones and I can prepare for our call to walk you through some items. \n \nHere are a few that I was able to get answers on. I will have to circle back with a few team members next week to get the rest:\n1.\tFlock App - It looks like this is currently only supposed to be used with a vehicle with license plate (photo tool)\n\t*\tDo you mind making sure your app is updated?\n\t*\tCan you try this again? Take a photo of a license plate that you know definitely drove past a camera (could be your vehicle)\n2.\tFreeform - I will let our team know about Freeform demo and we will get that scheduled\n3.\tBank (Raven Alerts) - Can you confirm this is the correct Bank institution?\n\t*\tChad Dr (HQ) - Oregon Community Credit Union (OR)\n\t*\tOnce you confirm I will create a support ticket to make sure that is setup on the backend\n4.\tTransparency Portal - I sent you the link, let us know if you need any additional edits (include in a word doc and I can update that)\n5.\tDownload PDF  - Your feedback: automatically 1 by 1 vs. all on the same page - too small). I will circle back, I think at this time it will be product feedback rather than a solution we currently have \n6.\tHeat Map - Can you search a license plate > right corner instead of going to the map view like we did can you toggle to \"look up\" and let me know if this works?\n\t*\tAlso, on the search card, you can click Nationwide Look Up or State Look Up and you should be able to see the heat map for that as well\n\t*\tInstructions HERE https://help.flocksafety.com/s/article/How-to-Use-the-Lookup-Tool-in-Search  (photo example down below)\n\t*\t\n7.\tDevice Group - This does look like you have to toggle on the device group each time. Supposedly, this is setup for a specific purpose and each agency has a specific use case so it's not a one size fits all model\n\t*\tA small workaround to get a little more of a fix is to click the \"flag\" on the card to use your last search (you would need to update some of the reasons though such as reason/license plate/etc)\n\t*\tHERE https://help.flocksafety.com/s/article/How-to-Use-the-Search-Tool-Redesign is an article with some instructions (photo example down below)\n\t*\t\n \nLet me know if I'm missing anything!\n \nThank you,\nGaby \n-- \n\t\nGaby Mahoney\nCustomer Success Manager\n\n https://www.instagram.com/flocksafety/ \n\n\n <https://gifo.srv.wisestamp.com/s/rfw4/108062/26/trans.png>  flocksafety.com \n\t\n https://www.flocksafety.com/articles/1000-missing-persons-reunited?utm_campaign=EmailSignature&utm_source=Success&utm_medium=Wisestamp \n\t\n \n\t\n \n <https://tracy.srv.wisestamp.com/px/wsid/m9AoG419PPOj.png>",
