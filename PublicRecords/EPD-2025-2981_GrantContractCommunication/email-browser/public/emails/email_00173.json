He anticipates planning to connect with your install techs sometime this week and we briefly talked about the request for assistance for traffic control.  \n\n \n\nOn a separate note, I reached out to the ODOT regional manager and waiting for a call back to discuss moving forward on the locations controlled by ODOT.
