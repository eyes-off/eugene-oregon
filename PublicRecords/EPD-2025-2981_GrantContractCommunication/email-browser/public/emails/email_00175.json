Just asked that we reach out to him before the installs begin. This means we have pushed all city locations through to scheduling. Difficult to give a timeframe on the installs but the steps to schedule the site surveys, 811 surveys, and then the physical installations are underway.\n\n\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\tI will keep you updated on these along with the other pending permits. Please let me know if you have any questions.\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tRegards\n\n\t\n \n\nMatt Triana\nProject Manager\n\n\n\n\t\n https://www.yourbasin.com/news/reeves-co-kidnapping-suspect-missing-14-year-old-found-in-san-antonio?utm_campaign=EmailSignature&utm_source=PMO&utm_medium=Wisestamp \n\n\t\n \n\n\t\t\t\t <https://tracy.srv.wisestamp.com/px/wsid/9qJpDWYgGPwa.png> \n\n\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\tOn Fri, Apr 18, 2025 at 12:26?PM Caroline Fraher <caroline.fraher@flocksafety.com caroline.fraher@flocksafety.com > wrote:\n\n\t\t\t\t\tThank you Capt Burke!\n\n\t\n \n\nCaroline Fraher\nAccount Executive\n\n\n\n https://www.instagram.com/flocksafety/ \n\n <https://gifo.srv.wisestamp.com/s/rfcustom/108062/26/trans.png>  caroline.fraher@flocksafety.com caroline.fraher@flocksafety.com \n\n\t\n https://www.flocksafety.com/flock-forward?utm_campaign=EmailSignature&utm_source=LETSM&utm_medium=Wisestamp \n\n\t\n \n\n\t\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\t <https://tracy.srv.wisestamp.com/px/wsid/v7qr7KEwo3rp.png> \n\n\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\tOn Fri, Apr 18, 2025 at 12:02?PM BURKE Jacob T <JBurke@eugene-or.gov JBurke@eugene-or.gov > wrote:\n\n\t\t\t\t\tODOT responded. \n\n\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\tContact for ODOT:\n\n\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\tJim Gamble\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDistrict 5 Manager\n\n\t\t\t\t\tODOT, Region 2\n\n\t\t\t\t\t2080 Laura Street Springfield OR 97477\n\n\t\t\t\t\tOffice: 541-726-2541\n\n\t\t\t\t\tEmail: James.GAMBLE@odot.oregon.gov James.GAMBLE@odot.oregon.gov \n\n\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\tJake Burke\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCaptain � Investigations Division\n\n\t\t\t\t\tEugene Police Department\n\n\t\t\t\t\t300 Country Club Road\n\n\t\t\t\t\tEugene, Oregon 97401\n\n\t\t\t\t\t(541) 682-5895 work"
