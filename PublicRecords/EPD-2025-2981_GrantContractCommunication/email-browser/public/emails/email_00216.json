Once I get that confirmation, we can start coordinating with you guys to schedule the installs and start calling for locates. \n\n-- \n\n\t\n \nMatthew Yang\nPermitting Manager\n\n\n\n https://www.instagram.com/flocksafety/ \n <https://gifo.srv.wisestamp.com/s/rfw4/108062/26/trans.png>  flocksafety.com \n\n\t\n https://www.flocksafety.com/articles/flock-safety-secures-major-funding?utm_campaign=EmailSignature&utm_source=Permitting&utm_medium=Wisestamp \n\n\t\n \n\n\t\n \t \n <https://tracy.srv.wisestamp.com/px/wsid/N8veDmd2XwqA.png>",
