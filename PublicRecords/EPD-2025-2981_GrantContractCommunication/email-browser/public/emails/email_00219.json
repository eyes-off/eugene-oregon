We can install there though. We will just need permission from the property owner. Should we move forward with updating your map? In the pic below, the green is not viable for install due to solar obstacles. The red area, someone's front yard, is good for install\n\t\n\t\n\tP52 Everything east of the red line is city of River Road ROW. We can move it east if they are willing to permit us. Do you think they would approve of this?\n\t\n\t \n\tThe yellow icons in the above show where the cameras are at now.
