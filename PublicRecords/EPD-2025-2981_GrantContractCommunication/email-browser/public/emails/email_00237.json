Per it, you are going to see about locating a parcel map showing the boundaries of this private property. Our records show the property line starting at about 70' from the I-5 which is too far for our cameras. You thought this might be inaccurate so once you are able to gather a little more info, we should be able to clear up where the property lines are and what the best install location will be.\n\n\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\tRegards\n\n\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\n \n\nMatt Triana\nProject Manager\n\n\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t <https://tracy.srv.wisestamp.com/px/wsid/N8dQjWVQ3Zda.png> \n\n\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\tOn Tue, Apr 8, 2025 at 10:31?AM DEWITT Derek A <DDeWitt@eugene-or.gov DDeWitt@eugene-or.gov > wrote:\n\n\t\t\t\t\tGood morning,\n\n\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\tI checked the Deployment Tracker map and it looks like all updates were added with the exception of one.  F#015 is a duplicate of one just further to the West.  We were moving that one to private property to catch a view of I-5 southbound.  That camera location will be 89733 Armitage Road (Johnson Vegetable Farms).  I sent pictures and Google map pins to show the purposed location in a previous email.  I just wanted to make sure that was on your radar.  We have verbal permission from the property owner who said he would sign the associated form.

The majority of these fall within city and county ROWs with a handful falling ODOT ROW. Per our call, at this time we are pending the official 'yes' from ODOT.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\tOur permitting team is diligently working to secure the necessary approvals. We acknowledge that this process can be time-consuming, and we assure you that we will provide timely updates as soon as permit approvals are obtained. If you come across contacts for anyone within \n\n\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\tHere is also the deployment tracker link we discussed. The Deployment Tracker [link https://planner.flocksafety.com/planning-portal/deployment-tracker ] will be your go-to resource for the latest dates/statuses for each location, and it also shows the latest statuses on your other locations that may not yet be in this phase. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tIn order to use this tracker, you will need to set up your FlockOS login information. You should receive an email from hello@flocksafety.com hello@flocksafety.com  with instructions. \n\n\t\t\t\t\t \n\nImplementation Status\n\n# of Devices\n\nNotes\n\nPlanning\n\n0\n\n\t\nPermitting\n\n57\n\nF001-F057\n\nInstalling\n\n0\n\n\t\nIn Service\n\n0\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tFor additional location information, please navigate to your Deployment Plan (link here) https://planner.flocksafety.com/planning-portal/deployment-tracker/public/0f92e14e805f30bf6acf29115ee1c582fb84f5a18bfa866c4d81a0a2bb69fa947c69170fc1a1d44eb6b6763d27128087a45d900051bba878beafbe3abb1f89bd \n\n\t\t\t\t\tand the Deployment Tracker [link https://planner.flocksafety.com/planning-portal/deployment-tracker ] \n\n\t\t\t\t\tI look forward to working with you on this project!\n\n\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\tBest,"
