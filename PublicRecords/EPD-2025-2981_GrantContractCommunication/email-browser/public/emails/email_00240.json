We acknowledge that this process can be time-consuming, and we assure you that we will provide timely updates as soon as permit approvals are obtained. If you come across contacts for anyone within \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\tHere is also the deployment tracker link we discussed. The Deployment Tracker [link https://planner.flocksafety.com/planning-portal/deployment-tracker ] will be your go-to resource for the latest dates/statuses for each location, and it also shows the latest statuses on your other locations that may not yet be in this phase. \n\t\t\t\tIn order to use this tracker, you will need to set up your FlockOS login information. You should receive an email from hello@flocksafety.com hello@flocksafety.com  with instructions. \n\t\t\t\t \nImplementation Status\n# of Devices\nNotes\nPlanning\n0\n\t\nPermitting\n57\nF001-F057\nInstalling\n0\n\t\nIn Service\n0\n\t\n\t\t\t\tFor additional location information, please navigate to your Deployment Plan (link here) https://planner.flocksafety.com/planning-portal/deployment-tracker/public/0f92e14e805f30bf6acf29115ee1c582fb84f5a18bfa866c4d81a0a2bb69fa947c69170fc1a1d44eb6b6763d27128087a45d900051bba878beafbe3abb1f89bd \n\t\t\t\tand the Deployment Tracker [link https://planner.flocksafety.com/planning-portal/deployment-tracker ] \n\t\t\t\tI look forward to working with you on this project!\n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\tBest,"
