Per it, you are going to see about locating a parcel map showing the boundaries of this private property. Our records show the property line starting at about 70' from the I-5 which is too far for our cameras. You thought this might be inaccurate so once you are able to gather a little more info, we should be able to clear up where the property lines are and what the best install location will be.\n\n\nRegards\n\n\t\n \nMatt Triana\nProject Manager\n\n\n\n \t \n <https://tracy.srv.wisestamp.com/px/wsid/N8dQjWVQ3Zda.png> \n\n\nOn Tue, Apr 8, 2025 at 10:31?AM DEWITT Derek A <DDeWitt@eugene-or.gov DDeWitt@eugene-or.gov > wrote:\n\n\n\tGood morning,\n\n\t \n\n\tI checked the Deployment Tracker map and it looks like all updates were added with the exception of one.
