The majority of these fall within city and county ROWs with a handful falling ODOT ROW. Per our call, at this time we are pending the official 'yes' from ODOT.\n\n\nOur permitting team is diligently working to secure the necessary approvals. We acknowledge that this process can be time-consuming, and we assure you that we will provide timely updates as soon as permit approvals are obtained. If you come across contacts for anyone within \n\n\n\n\nHere is also the deployment tracker link we discussed. The Deployment Tracker [link https://planner.flocksafety.com/planning-portal/deployment-tracker ] will be your go-to resource for the latest dates/statuses for each location, and it also shows the latest statuses on your other locations that may not yet be in this phase. \n\nIn order to use this tracker, you will need to set up your FlockOS login information.
