Flock will manage the installation of any poles, and we require customer sign off on exact location before we put anything in the ground. If someone wants to avoid a pole going in landscaping, we can simply find another location.\n\nFor our HOA and commercial customers, it comes with one sign per Flock camera. Any additional signs are $30/each. \n\t\n \nCaroline Fraher\nAccount Executive\n\n\n\n https://www.instagram.com/flocksafety/ \n\n <https://gifo.srv.wisestamp.com/s/rfcustom/108062/26/trans.png>  caroline.fraher@flocksafety.com caroline.fraher@flocksafety.com \n\n\t\n https://www.flocksafety.com/articles/flock-safety-secures-major-funding?utm_campaign=EmailSignature&utm_source=LETSM&utm_medium=Wisestamp \n\n\t\n \n\n\t\n \t \n <https://tracy.srv.wisestamp.com/px/wsid/LqYnr2GL2QLy.png>",
