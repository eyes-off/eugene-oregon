We are excited to get Eugene PD's cameras up and running. As a next step, I'd like to schedule your Onboarding Kickoff Call to:\n\n*\t Introduce you to your dedicated Project Manager, Matt Triana\n*\tIntroduce you to your dedicated Success Manager, Emily Atzen\n*\t Provide an overview of the Flock <> Eugene PD partnership.\n*\t Review installation timeline & expectations\n*\t Review your department's goals & account preferences.\n\nI'm sending over an invite for  for all of us to meet this Thursday 3/27 at 2pm. If that does not work, please let me know and we have plenty of availability next week. If you're able to include public works, or the contact who will be issuing city permits, that would be very helpful. \n\nI'm going to stay closely connected to this project to make sure that everything goes off as smoothly as possible. If you ever need anything do not hesitate to reach out via email or directly on my cell at (310) 844-3659.
