The Flock Work Order has been integrated as Exhibit B, and the Flock MSA has been included as Exhibit D (including Flocks information on Insurance). Please note, we corrected a few Exhibit references which referenced the wrong Exhibit letter due to combining City and Flock documents that looked to have generally followed a slightly different order.\n \nPlease forward this contract for review, and if everything is in order, sign and return a copy to the City (EPD). We will get the contract routed for countersignature immediately following that through our internal process with the intent to have the contract signed before the end of the month. \n \nIf there are any questions, please let me know as soon as possible as we are all working toward the goal of having the contract executed by the end of the month.
