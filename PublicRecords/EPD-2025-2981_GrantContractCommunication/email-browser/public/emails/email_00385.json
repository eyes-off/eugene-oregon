Learn why this is important <https://aka.ms/LearnAboutSenderIdentification>  \n\t\n[EXTERNAL ?]\nA note from Axon's Founder & CEO\n https://go.axon.com/e/636291/2025-02-03/4kt5n3/2873491052/h/ZynaNJwSpcEt9CJUOqdj9t7KU33KnDvuPO1Gdd9wpzY \n \nHello,\n\nI am writing to address a misleading letter you may have received from Flock Safety regarding Axon�s recent termination of its partnership agreement with Flock.\n\nWe are 100% committed to bi-directional integrations with all public safety technology companies that service our customers, and this includes Flock. Unfortunately Flock has demonstrated a pattern of behavior that creates barriers for customer integrations in attempts to create a digital silo and coerce customers to purchase additional Flock services over Axon�s.\n\nFlock began by charging excessive fees for API integrations between Flock and Axon systems ranging from $10,000 to $50,000 per year. For example, we were surprised and disappointed to receive from a customer this exchange they had with Flock:\n \n\t\"I would be doing you a disservice if I didn't let you know up front that there will be a $10,000 yearly charge to integrate our cameras into Fusus. However, with FlockOS, there is no cost for this as they are our products, AND we can integrate the Axon products you currently have at no cost.\"\n\t \nFlock has now escalated the situation by flat out refusing to allow Axon Fusus customers to have ALPR Search integrations from their own Flock cameras in an effort to strong-arm customers to switch to its platform.\n\nAfter dealing with consistent customer frustrations over this situation, we have chosen to terminate our partnership agreement with Flock. One of our core values is \"Win Right\" � and this clearly doesn�t fit.\n\nWhat does this mean for you? \n\nWe remain 100% committed to reciprocal integrations across our products. This means that:\n�\nAxon will honor all existing live and contracted deployments in both directions indefinitely, and we hope and expect Flock to do the same.\n�\nUntil Flock agrees to stop blocking customers on reciprocal integrations, we are forced to pause new integrations that are not already under contract. We sincerely hope Flock will agree to bi-directional integrations between the platforms that give customers the freedom to choose the best system for their needs, free of coercive behavior.\n�\nAxon will continue to do everything we can to give you the best possible solution, and we will change nothing on our side that impacts your current experience.\nThe simple fact is that we can no longer stand by while Flock is actively blocking customers from using their own data from Flock cameras with our Fusus platform, while also exploiting the free integration we have always enabled from Fleet and other Axon products to Flock.\n\nFor clarity: we have a standing offer to Flock to have free, unfettered, bidirectional data sharing of ALPR data between our systems, allowing customers to choose the system that best fits their needs.\n\nIf you would like to help us drive this situation to fast resolution, I suggest customers reach out directly to Flock to demand they stop this anti-competitive behavior and immediately stop blocking public safety agencies from integrating their data into other criminal justice tech platforms, including Axon Fusus. (For ease of reference: garrett@flocksafety.com garrett@flocksafety.com  is the CEO�s email).\n\nAxon was an early investor in Flock because we believed our systems would be complementary, and accelerate important new capabilities for public safety. I personally introduced Flock to dozens of agencies with the promise that our partnership would provide seamless integration of Axon�s mobile ALPR and Flock�s fixed ALPR. I know that many of you purchased Flock systems based on my personal endorsement of them as a strategic partner of Axon, and I am personally embarrassed and I sincerely apologize that the situation has deteriorated to this point. I am sorry and I will not allow this situation to disrupt your operations in any way.\n\nIf you would like to learn more or have questions, I will be hosting several Zoom sessions to answer questions. Just reply �Zoom please� to this email and we will coordinate a time that works for you.\n\nThank you, and stay safe,\n\nRick Smith\nAxon Founder & CEO\n https://go.axon.com/e/636291/2025-02-03/4kt5n3/2873491052/h/ZynaNJwSpcEt9CJUOqdj9t7KU33KnDvuPO1Gdd9wpzY \nAxon Enterprise, Inc. 17800 N. 85th St. Scottsdale, AZ 85255-6311, USA\nThe Delta Logo, the Axon & Design Logo, Axon, TASER, Bolt with Circle Logo, and Protect Life are trademarks of Axon Enterprise, Inc., some of which are registered in the US and other countries.
