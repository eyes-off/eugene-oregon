I am glad we are aligned on the rest of the procurement process.\n\nTo summarize, here are everyone's homework assignments:\n\nTim - Tim to send Caroline the City's standard T&C for review. Caroline and Tim to work through the legal review process with Flocks legal and Eugene's CA.\n\nCaptain Burke - Capt Burke to confirm with Chief if council approval is needed -  if so, ideally 2/24, 3/10, or 3/24 council date to get on agenda. Introduce Caroline to IT to confirm they have all necessary documents/questions answered. \n\nCaroline- \nI have attached Flock's legal documents for your attorney's review:\n\n*\tOrder Form Exhibit A. This document outlines the products, payment terms, subscription term length, etc. This is the doc that will eventually be signed. We will update the term length and # of products as Caroline and Capt Burke finalize the deployment map.\n*\tExhibit B- Master Services Agreement (MSA). This is terms and conditions that will need to be approved by your attorney. Flock's legal team is easy to work with on comments/redlines, but they do request that all comments are made via Microsoft Word Track Changes.\n*\tExhibit C - Customer Implementation Guide. This is the guide to installation, no review of signatures needed on this\n\nThank you again! Please don't hesitate to give me a shout at any time. \n\t\n <https://d36urhup7zbd7q.cloudfront.net/e/bc3890fd-3467-438b-8979-68f071c011ec.png> \t\nCaroline Fraher\nTerritory Sales Manager\n\n https://sales.flocksafety.com/t/102869/sc/c5ffb8fb-ac20-4583-9173-bb8c7aedcb29/NB2HI4DTHIXS653XO4XGY2LONNSWI2LOFZRW63JPMNXW24DBNZ4S6ZTMN5RWWLLTMFTGK5DZ/HFQWIMRQGQ4WIODDGFTDSM3EHFRDAYRXGEYWEMBUMRSDQNJWHA4TANJZGAYGEY3C/www-linkedin-com-company-flock-safety \n\n https://sales.flocksafety.com/t/102869/sc/c5ffb8fb-ac20-4583-9173-bb8c7aedcb29/NB2HI4DTHIXS653XO4XGS3TTORQWO4TBNUXGG33NF5TGY33DNNZWCZTFOR4S6===/MFTDKYZSGFTGMODGGBSTOYZUGZQTKMRUMU3GIMLGMU3WGYLCMRTGCZRSGI2DCNJV/www-instagram-com-flocksafety \n\n https://sales.flocksafety.com/t/102869/sc/c5ffb8fb-ac20-4583-9173-bb8c7aedcb29/NB2HI4DTHIXS653XO4XGMYLDMVRG633LFZRW63JPMZWG6Y3LONQWMZLUPE======/MZRWCNBYGE4DSYZXGY3TIMBUG43GMZJZGJSWMYLDMFRTMZBSME2TGNBSGRRTGNRZ/www-facebook-com-flocksafety \n\n https://sales.flocksafety.com/t/102869/sc/c5ffb8fb-ac20-4583-9173-bb8c7aedcb29/NB2HI4DTHIXS653XO4XHS33VOR2WEZJOMNXW2L3DF5DGY33DNNJWCZTFOR4Q====/GUYWIZBZMVRWMNBSGQ3WGMJZGZTDAZRUG5TDGNTFGMYDMNZXG5SGGNZYHAYTINBT/www-youtube-com-c-flocksafety \n\n <https://cdn.gifo.wisestamp.com/s/rfm1/108062/26/trans.png>  310-844-3659 call/text <tel:310-844-3659call/text>    <https://cdn.gifo.wisestamp.com/s/rfw4/108062/26/trans.png>  flocksafety.com\n\n <https://cdn.gifo.wisestamp.com/s/rfcustom/108062/26/trans.png>  caroline.fraher@flocksafety.com caroline.fraher@flocksafety.com \n\n\t\n <https://d36urhup7zbd7q.cloudfront.net/u/Qowpxb7DNle/1683134561052.png> \n\n\t\n https://sales.flocksafety.com/t/102869/sc/c5ffb8fb-ac20-4583-9173-bb8c7aedcb29/NB2HI4DTHIXS63DJNZVS4ZTMN5RWW43BMZSXI6JOMNXW2LZUGBWXU6S2II======/MYZDIZLDGU3TENJVMI2GMOBUMZRTSNJWGY3WMYJVMNTGGYRVGY4DMY3DMYZTSMZW/link-flocksafety-com-40mzzzb \n\n\t\n \t \n <https://tracy.srv.wisestamp.com/px/wsid/QNLPvRoWrGG.png> \n <https://sales.flocksafety.com/t/102869/open/c5ffb8fb-ac20-4583-9173-bb8c7aedcb29.gif>",
