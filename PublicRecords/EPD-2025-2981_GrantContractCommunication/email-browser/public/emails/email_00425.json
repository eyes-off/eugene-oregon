I'll send that list over by EOD tomorrow. \n\n\tHere is the camera map we put together earlier this year. We will better organize the deployment as we work through finalizing your location selections. Seth and I are available to meet to go over the map:\n\tTuesday 1/21 - 11am, 12pm, 3pm\n\tWed 1/22 anytime between 12-3:30\n\tFriday 1/24 anytime after 12 \n\tThe following week we are going to Atlanta for a company meeting but could meet on Thursday or Friday. \n\t\n\t\n\tMeeting 2 - discuss procurement w/ finance, discuss legal review, and gameplan for council/community engagement \n\tTuesday 1/21- anytime\n\tWednesday 1/22 - anytime after 12\n\tThursday -1/23 anytime before 1:30pm\n\t1/24 Friday anytime\n\n\tIf you could please let me know what works best for you, I can send the calendar invites.
