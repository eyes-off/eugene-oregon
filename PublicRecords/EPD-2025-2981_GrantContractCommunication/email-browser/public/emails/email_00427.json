We are so appreciative of the opportunity to present to you, Lane Co, and Springfield, and are excited to partner with you on your real time policing tech efforts. \n\nAs a follow up, I propose we have two separate meetings (in no particular order)\n\nMeeting 1- review camera map deployment to determine locations and final cost. \nCrunching some numbers, with $330k to spend over 2 years, that gives us 55ish cameras, give or take depending on installation and Falcon type. I am going to have my team cross reference Springfield's camera map to see which ones are on your border. I'll send that list over by EOD tomorrow. \n\nHere is the camera map we put together earlier this year. We will better organize the deployment as we work through finalizing your location selections. Seth and I are available to meet to go over the map:\nTuesday 1/21 - 11am, 12pm, 3pm\nWed 1/22 anytime between 12-3:30\nFriday 1/24 anytime after 12 \nThe following week we are going to Atlanta for a company meeting but could meet on Thursday or Friday. \n\n\nMeeting 2 - discuss procurement w/ finance, discuss legal review, and gameplan for council/community engagement \nTuesday 1/21- anytime\nWednesday 1/22 - anytime after 12\nThursday -1/23 anytime before 1:30pm\n1/24 Friday anytime\n\nIf you could please let me know what works best for you, I can send the calendar invites.
