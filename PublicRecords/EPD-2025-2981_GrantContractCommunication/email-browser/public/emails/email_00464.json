The camera share process is manual on the Flock side and once approved we will do our best to complete these in a timely manner. \n\nIf your agency has any questions or concerns, they may reach out to their Flock Customer Success Manager who will direct them to the appropriate contact. \n� \nEmail Subject Line- Lowe�s Camera Share; Name of the Agency\nEmail Template sent to: todd.a.isenhour@lowes.com and CC emma.jensen@flocksafety.com \n\n\nAs TITLE for CITY/ COUNTY, I would like to formally request regional access to Lowe�s owned Flock safety systems and/or LiveView. This technology will assist in preventing or investigating criminal activity in the local community we both serve. Lowe�s technology and my department�s access to such will only be used for bona fide investigations, which are documented within our department and via audit trail within the Flock Safety platform.
