## Response
The City of Eugene has conducted research and determined that the City is not the custodian of the requested records. Any permits or installation records would be held by Flock Safety.

The City does not possess the requested records and the City considers this request closed.

The City estimates that .5 hours of staff time were utilized to search in an attempt to identify responsive records. The City will issue a refund in the amount of $79.81 for the unused research time.
