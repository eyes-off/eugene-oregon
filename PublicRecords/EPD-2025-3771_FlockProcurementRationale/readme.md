To Whom It May Concern:

This request is made pursuant to Oregon’s Public Records Law, ORS 192.311–192.478.

Time frame: The earliest planning for Flock/ALPR to present

Scope:
I request non-email records from the earliest planning for Flock/ALPR through the present that describe or authorize the acquisition of Flock Safety ALPR equipment/services, including:
1. Needs/problem statements
2. Cost-benefit or impact assessments
3. Budget justifications
4. Staff reports and meeting minutes
5. Procurement justifications (RFP/sole source)
6. Vendor proposals
7. Statements of work
8. Evaluations tied to expected or actual outcomes.

If any responsive records are held by City Procurement/Finance or other departments, please forward.

Preferred Format:
- Please provide records electronically via email or secure download.
- Tabular data as CSV/Excel
- Documents as searchable PDFs

Fee Waiver Request:
I request a fee waiver under ORS 192.324(5) because disclosure primarily benefits the public by informing community understanding of ALPR-driven enforcement, public impact and awareness of budget based items. I am requesting these records for noncommercial purposes and the results will be made publicly available. These records will be actively shared and used by community groups throughout Eugene. If fees will exceed $50, please provide a written cost estimate and do not proceed without confirmation.

Please cite specific statutes for any redactions.

Please contact me if you have questions

Sincerely
