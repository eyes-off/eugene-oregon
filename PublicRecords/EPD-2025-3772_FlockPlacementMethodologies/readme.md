## Request 


To Whom It May Concern:

This request is made pursuant to Oregon’s Public Records Law, ORS 192.311–192.478.

Timeframe: The earliest planning for Flock/ALPR to present

Scope:
I request non-email records that detail how ALPR/Flock camera locations were selected, including criteria, methodologies, scoring rubrics, maps/heat maps, datasets used (crime, CFS, traffic), equity/privacy impact analyses, siting plans (“camera placement plans”), and any MOUs/permissions related to placement on public or private property. Include revisions/updates over time and any vendor-provided siting analyses.
Possible Custodians Involved:
- EPD Operations/Patrol leadership (Captains/Lieutenants) and Traffic Unit supervisors — decision memos and deployment plans.
- Crime Analysis/Analytics Unit — hotspot analyses, criteria, heat maps, scoring rubrics, underlying datasets.
- EPD Technology/Systems Unit and City IT — Flock portal access, camera inventory, network/power notes, exports.
- EPD Training/Policy or Professional Standards — any SOPs/guidance on siting considerations.
- City GIS — ArcGIS layers, siting maps, geodata used for analysis.
- Public Works/Transportation/Right-of-Way — pole/trailer placement, ROW permits, traffic control plans, utility locates.
- City Procurement/Finance — vendor proposals, statements of work, and siting deliverables.
- City Attorney/Risk — MOUs/property permissions, indemnity or privacy impact language tied to locations.
- External utilities and partners (if applicable) — e.g., Eugene Water & Electric Board (pole attachment/energizing), school districts, HOAs, or businesses that host cameras.

Forward to the appropriate custodians as needed.

Systems/locations to search:
- Flock Safety portal (and admin exports):
--- Camera Locations/Inventory export (CSV), including camera IDs, lat/long, status.
--- Activity by Camera/Detections reports used to justify or reevaluate sites.
--- Any “Siting” or “Deployment” PDFs provided by Flock (often uploaded/linked via the account).
- ArcGIS/City GIS:
--- MXD/APRX projects, hosted feature layers, shapefiles, GeoJSON/KML for proposed/approved camera locations and analysis layers (crime, CFS, traffic volumes, crashes).
- CAD/RMS attachments or SharePoint/Teams/Network drives: “ALPR,” “Flock,” “Siting,” “Deployment,” “Camera Placement” folders.
- Permit/asset systems:
--- ROW/encroachment permit databases, pole attachment records, utility locate tickets, work orders.
- Procurement/contract registers: SOWs, vendor responses with siting sections.

Document types/titles that are commonly used
- “Camera Placement Plan,” “Siting Analysis,” “Site Selection Criteria,” “Hotspot/Heat Map,” “Ingress/Egress Analysis,” “Coverage/ROI Assessment,” “Deployment Plan,” “Pilot Report,” “Location Proposal,” “Siting Walk Notes,” “Camera Map,” “Camera Inventory,” “Re-siting/Relocation Justification.”
- Vendor-authored: “Flock Siting Recommendations,” “Deployment Overview,” “Success Plan,” “Falcon install plan,” “Trailer deployment plan,” “Camera location workbook.”

Keywords and vendor terms (use singular/plural and acronyms)
- Core: Flock, “Flock Safety,” ALPR, LPR, “license plate,” “camera placement,” siting, “site selection,” “deployment plan,” “location proposal,” “mount,” “install,” “pole,” “trailer,” “solar,” “power,” “LTE,” “ingress,” “egress,” hotspot, “heat map,” scoring, rubric, criteria.
- Validation/constraints: ROW, right-of-way, encroachment, utility locate, easement, MOU, permission, indemnity, privacy, equity, impact, “traffic control plan.”
- Camera/asset fields: “camera ID,” “Falcon,” “Raven,” “camera list,” “camera map,” “lat,” “lon,” “coordinates.”
- Comparative vendors (captures “why here/why this” docs if alternatives were considered): Rekor, Vigilant/Motorola, Genetec AutoVu, OpenALPR

Preferred Format:
- Please provide records electronically via email or secure download.
- GIS layers and files (shp, gdb, aprx/mxd, kml/kmz, GeoJSON) for proposed and final camera locations, plus any heat maps or kernel density rasters used for siting.
- Tabular datasets used in siting: crime incidents (especially UUV/UUMV/stolen vehicle recovery), calls for service, traffic volumes, collision data — with data dictionaries.
- Camera inventory in CSV with fields: camera id, name, type, status (proposed/active/inactive), install date, location (address, lat/long), host/owner (public/private), and justification/rationale if tracked.
- Searchable PDFs for other documents

Fee Waiver Request:
I request a fee waiver under ORS 192.324(5) because disclosure primarily benefits the public by informing community understanding of ALPR-driven enforcement and public impact. I am requesting these records for noncommercial purposes and the results will be made publicly available. These records will be actively shared and used by community groups throughout Eugene. If fees will exceed $50, please provide a written cost estimate and do not proceed without confirmation.
Please cite specific statutes for any redactions.

Please contact me if you have questions

Sincerely,

Seth May
