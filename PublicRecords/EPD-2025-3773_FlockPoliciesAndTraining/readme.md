## Request 
To Whom It May Concern:
This request is made pursuant to Oregon’s Public Records Law, ORS 192.311–192.478.

Timeframe: 1/1/2025 to present

Scope:
I request non-email records covering policies, SOPs, directives, training materials, and legal guidance on:
- When and how Flock/ALPR alerts may be used to initiate or justify stops or detentions;
- Requirements for independent corroboration or verification before enforcement action;
- Documentation/reporting expectations for ALPR-related stops;
- Procedures for verifying hits and handling mismatches/false positives;
- Audit, QA, and error-rate monitoring related to ALPR; and
- Retention, access, and dissemination restrictions.
- Include revision histories or policy memos explaining changes.

Preferred Format:
- Please provide records electronically via email or secure download.
- Searchable PDFs.

Please forward to the appropriate custodian (e.g., policy/training/legal custodians) as needed.

Fee Waiver Request
I request a fee waiver under ORS 192.324(5) because disclosure primarily benefits the public by informing community understanding of ALPR-driven enforcement and public impact. I am requesting these records for noncommercial purposes and intend to make the results publicly available. These records will be actively shared and used by community groups throughout Eugene. If fees will exceed $50, please provide a written cost estimate and do not proceed without confirmation.

Please cite specific statutes for any redactions.

Please contact me if you have questions

Sincerely,

Seth May
