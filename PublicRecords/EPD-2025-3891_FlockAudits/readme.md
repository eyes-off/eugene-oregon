## Request 
To the Public Records Manager,

This request is made pursuant to Oregon’s Public Records Law, ORS 192.311–192.478 for the following records:

1. Organization Audit in Flock.
The report should include data logged from the period of March 1, 2025, to the date this request is processed. Per Flock's documentation, the Organization Audit is available within the Insights tab and is defined as searches done within the agency.

2. Network Audit in Flock.
The report should include data logged from the period of March 1, 2025, to the date this request is processed. Per Flock's documentation, the Network Audit is available within the Insights tab and is defined as searches of the organization’s Flock network by any agency in the Flock System.

I request a fee waiver under ORS 192.324(5) because disclosure primarily benefits the public by informing community understanding of surveillance-based enforcement and public impact. I am requesting these records for noncommercial purposes and intend to make the results publicly available. These records will be actively shared and used by community groups throughout Eugene. If fees will exceed $25, please provide a written cost estimate and do not proceed without confirmation.

Please provide the audit data in a structured format such as .csv, .xls, or another machine-readable database filetype. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or another electronic format if not.
Thank you in advance for your cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request.

Sincerely,
Seth May
