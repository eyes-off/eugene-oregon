# PRR - List of Flock Public Records Requests, June-Oct 2025 [2510-06]

## Request Id:
* EPD-2025-4537

## Status
* Close - Fulfilled

## Request 
To the Public Records Manager,

I request a log of submitted public records requests as submitted through the justfoia.com application from 6/1/2025 to the present that have the word Flock or ALPR in the description.

I’m making this request since there are no functioning search features made available online by the city, so this is the only method I have of viewing previously submitted requests.

Please utilize the advanced reporting features within the justfoia.com application to generate this list. I am particularly interested in accessing the following details for each request:
* Request ID or Reference Number
* Date of Submission
* Requestor Information (if permissible under privacy regulations)
* Title / Description of the Requested Records (enough information to know what the request was asking for)
* Current Status of the Request
* The date the request was closed
* The amount charged for each request
* If the charge was paid

This is intended to be a very light-weight request. If the way I’ve written this creates more than simple reporting work, please help me adjust it to be more specific. If there are any potential issues or permissions required to fulfill this request, please let me know at your earliest convenience. I am eager to work collaboratively with your office to ensure this request is easy to generate and complies with any applicable policies and procedures.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to your response.

Sincerely,
