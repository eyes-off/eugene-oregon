To the Public Records Manager,

This request is made pursuant to Oregon’s Public Records Law, ORS 192.311–192.478.

I am requesting access to Organized Retail Theft grant quarterly reports made by the Eugene Police Department. Additionally, I would like any grant modification requests that have been submitted.
