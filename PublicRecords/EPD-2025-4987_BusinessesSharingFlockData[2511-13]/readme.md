## Request 
To the Public Records Manager, 

This request is made pursuant to Oregon’s Public Records Law, ORS 192.311–192.478. 

I am requesting records identifying private businesses, homeowner associations, or other non-governmental entities that currently share Flock Safety or other automatic license plate reader (ALPR) camera data with the Eugene Police Department. If a list is not available, I would appreciate any agreements or memoranda of understanding authorizing this data-sharing relationship. 

If available, please provide the records in digital format. 

Thank you for your assistance, 
Geoffrey Gordon
