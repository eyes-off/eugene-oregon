To the Public Records Manager,

This request is made pursuant to Oregon’s Public Records Law, ORS 192.311–192.478 for the following records:

1. Organization Audit in Flock.
The report should include data logged from the period of March 1, 2025, to the date this request is processed. Per Flock's documentation, the Organization Audit is available within the Insights tab and is defined as searches done within the agency.

2. Network Audit in Flock.
The report should include data logged from the period of March 1, 2025, to the date this request is processed. Per Flock's documentation, the Network Audit is available within the Insights tab and is defined as searches of the organization’s Flock network by any agency in the Flock System.

To minimize the time and effort required by the city to fulfill this request, I would suggest that sensitive fields containing user name, plate number, and case number be redacted.

The requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.

Please provide the audit data in a structured format such as .csv, .xls, or another machine-readable database filetype. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or another electronic format if not.

Thank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.
