To the Public Records Manager,

This request is made pursuant to Oregon’s Public Records Law, ORS 192.311–192.478.
I am seeking documents that show who has access to the department’s Flock deployment and the access that is enabled/disabled for each user account. The report should include all available details including, but not limited to, the following where available: User Id, Name, Role, Identity Provider, Last login, User Mgmt, Search, Device Mgmt, Hotlist Tool.

Sincerely,
Seth May
